# 👋 Hi, I'm Ben 

I'm an MSc Physics student at **Ariel University** and a **researcher at the Remote Sensing Lab, Eastern R&D**, working on atmospheric and electromagnetic modeling using real-world data and deep learning.

With a dual background in **Physics** and **Electrical Engineering**, I focus on bridging scientific modeling with machine learning — especially in the context of **VLF wave propagation**, **ionospheric parameter estimation**, and **geophysical signal analysis**.
